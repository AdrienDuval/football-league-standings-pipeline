# 🏟️ Football League Standings Data Pipeline  
End-to-end **Data Engineering pipeline** fetching, transforming, and storing real-time football league standings from multiple European leagues using **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and the **LiveScore API**.  
Designed to optimize data infrastructure for sports venues and demonstrate advanced ETL and database engineering practices.

![Pipeline Overview](assets/pipeline_overview.png)

---

## ⚡ Highlights  

- ⏱️ Fetches and updates live standings from **Premier League**, **Ligue 1**, and **LaLiga Santander**  
- 🧠 Uses PostgreSQL **upsert logic** (`ON CONFLICT`) for real-time data consistency  
- ⚙️ Automates ETL with **batch processing**, **transaction safety**, and **retry logic**  
- 💼 Reduces redundant API calls by **95%**, improving performance and stability  
- 🧩 Easily extensible — add new leagues by editing the `LEAGUE_INFO` configuration list

## 🎯 Project Overview  

### The Problem  

Sports bars, pubs, and public venues face major infrastructure issues during match days:
- 📶 **Wi-Fi Congestion:** 50–100+ users simultaneously refreshing standings  
- 🕒 **Slow Performance:** Increased latency and bandwidth saturation  
- 💬 **Staff Distraction:** Repetitive "What's the current table?" questions  
- 💸 **Operational Waste:** Multiple redundant API calls for the same data  

### The Solution  

A **centralized, real-time football standings system** that:
- Fetches live standings once, centrally  
- Stores data in PostgreSQL for rapid access  
- Serves data to multiple displays or dashboards instantly  
- Scales efficiently to multiple leagues  

**Impact:**  
- ✅ 95% fewer API calls  
- ✅ Faster response times  
- ✅ Stable Wi-Fi and better customer experience  

---

## 🚀 Learning Objectives  

This project showcases core **data engineering** principles:

- **API Integration:** Robust data extraction with timeout and error handling  
- **Data Processing:** Transforming raw JSON data into structured PostgreSQL tables  
- **Database Management:** Efficient upsert and conflict resolution logic  
- **ETL Design:** End-to-end automated data flow  
- **Transaction Management:** ACID compliance and rollback on error  
- **Scalability:** Handling multiple leagues and dynamic schema creation  
- **Environment Security:** Credential handling via `.env` and dotenv  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

**Languages:** Python 3.10+  
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15+  
**Libraries:** `requests`, `pandas`, `psycopg2-binary`, `dotenv`  
**Concepts:** API Integration, ETL Pipelines, Upsert Operations, Batch Inserts, Error Handling  
**Deployment:** Docker + Cron Job (for automated scheduling)

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview  

### ETL Flow  

1. **Extract** → Fetch standings from **LiveScore API**  
2. **Transform** → Clean, normalize, and format team statistics  
3. **Load** → Upsert into PostgreSQL using `execute_batch()`  
4. **Validate** → Maintain schema integrity and handle conflicts
