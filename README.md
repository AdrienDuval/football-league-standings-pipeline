# Football League Standings Dashboard

A comprehensive data engineering solution that automatically fetches, processes, and stores real-time football league standings from multiple European leagues. This project solves critical infrastructure problems in sports venues while demonstrating advanced data engineering practices including API integration, database management, and ETL pipeline development.

## üéØ Project Overview

### The Problem
Sports bars, pubs, and public venues face a significant infrastructure challenge during football matches:
- **WiFi Congestion**: 50-100+ people simultaneously checking league standings on their phones
- **Poor User Experience**: Slow loading times, dropped connections, and frustrated customers
- **Bandwidth Waste**: Redundant API calls for the same data across multiple devices
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Staff constantly answering "What's the current table?" questions

### The Solution
This project provides a centralized, real-time football standings system that:
- **Eliminates WiFi Congestion**: Single API call instead of 50+ individual requests
- **Improves User Experience**: Instant access to current standings on venue displays
- **Reduces Operational Load**: Staff can focus on service instead of data requests
- **Enables Data Analytics**: Historical performance tracking and trend analysis
- **Scales Efficiently**: Supports multiple leagues with minimal resource usage
